## The DIP System
The double inverted pendulum (DIP) on a cart system consists of cart and two masses connected by rigid, massless rods as illustrated below. In addition, there is an horizontal external force u on the cart and damping Dc, D1, D2 on the cart velocity, angular velocity of mass one, and angular velocity of mass two respectively.

The EOMDerivation.py file derives the equations of motion of the system with lagrangian dynamics. For simplicity, the results are shown below.

## LQR Control
A linearâ€“quadratic regulator (LQR) was created to stabilize the DIP system about its unstable equilibrium with both rods straight up. Since LQR is a linear control method, the initial conditions when using the LQR have been restricted to enforce the small angle approximation which is necessary for the nonlinear DIP system to be approximated as linear. That said, there are still a few cases where the system will leave the small angle range and the controller will fail. The LQR controller developed is capable of handling both continuous and discrete time systems. 

## Future Improvements
- Add additional controllers
- Add plotting of state over time
- Improve the GUI
